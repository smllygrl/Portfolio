# My portfolio

This was the first challenge I was given during my time at _nology.

The requirements were to have three sections: about, contact and projects. 

We were also required to use SASS, and implement the block, elelemt and modifer (BEM) framework.

I have reiterated this project several times, and continue to refine this current version.

Items to be complete in my portfolio --
+ Media queries
+ Update pictures of my projects in their prospective links
