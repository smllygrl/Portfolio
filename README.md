# My portfolio

This was the first challenge I was given during my time at _nology.

The requirements were to have three sections: about, contact and projects. 

We were also required to use SASS, and implement the block, elelemt and modifer (BEM) framework.

I have reiterated this project several times, and continue to refine this current version.

The main learnings I have had during this project are --
+ Styling with flex box
+ Consolidated understanding of the box model
+ Working with coloured gradients
+ SCSS/CSS scope
+ How to link to other pages/ sections appropriately

Items to be complete in my portfolio --
+ Utilise Git branches with a develop & future feature branches
+ Media queries
+ Update pictures of my projects in their prospective links
